1.	Discuss importance of understanding the core meaning of simple.

The importance of understanding simple is that there’s only one thing that has to be fulfilled about a task. Does none mean its only one of said object or topic, but understanding that something simple usually requires one main focus. 



2.	Discuss the dangers of complexity.

The dangers of complexity is allowing something to be complex in the first place. Rich Hickey said himself that we as a culture use complex ideals all the time when we don’t have to. The danger in that is making a problem so complex for our selves that we run our selves into the ground before we can get an answer. 

   
3.	What are some of the techniques he discusses to achieve simplicity?

He says when making simple things, is to do “who, what, when, where, how”. This allows for problems to be broken down simply. This would allow for focus in one area and for things to be easily handled. 

4.	Discuss how to identify complexity.

Identifying complexity is like something that “folded together”. You can identify it by making things more difficult to be understand if it is now organize or don’t make the effort to do so.
