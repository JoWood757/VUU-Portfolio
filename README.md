My Name is Jonathan Woodhouse and this is my Portfolio of case studies and labs that I have completed at my time at Viringia Union. 

In this Portfolio there will be plenty of Labs and studies that covers database systems.

Over this course I used Jupyter Notebook for all of my assignments.

The Labs/Machine learning that were completed were, 

#Design Considerations 

#Graph Models

#Replications

#Transactions 

We Also had a case study that involved fundemental design concepts

This Case Study involved a video lecture of Rich Hickey explaing how making something complex is only something that is in the mind. Not to say something simple is easy, but making it complex is easy to do in the first place.
